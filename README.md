# Mapping Resources
### A collection of scripts and datasets for quick creation of figures for seismologists.

## November 2023 Update
These were originally written in April of 2023 when I was still learning Python and the code very clearly reflects that. I have since re-written about 90% of the code to be faster, easier, and more generalized to be applied to a wider variety of situations. Old scripts can still be found under legacy_scripts in case I ever need to reference it (highly doubtful).
